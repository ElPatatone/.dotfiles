# My configs

A repository dedicated to easily maintain all my config files for apps I use.  
It also has an install script which when run will set up an already heavily customised developement environment based on the config files

## How to use this

You don't have to install anything before running the `install.sh` script but make sure your system is upto date by running the commands `sudo apt update` and then `sudo apt upgrade`.

#### Steps

1. Clone the repository
2. Make the `install.sh` file executable with the command `chmod +x install.sh` and then run it.
3. Create a new terminal session to allow the changes to take place.
